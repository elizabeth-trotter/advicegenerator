### Project Scope: 

This was a single day challenge where I built out an advice generator with `TypeScript` and `React` based on a given prototype.

***Key Features:***

- [x] Hover effect when button is active
- [x] Ability to generate new random advice on button click
- [x] Responsive for Desktop and Mobile
